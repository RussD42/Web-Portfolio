            <h2> About Me </h2>
              <ul>  
                <li>After graduating high school, I became a Ford certified A/C and Electric technician and then eventually found my way into the hospitality industry as a manager for one of the largest resorts in the world!  I love problem-solving, being creative, and helping people.  This is why I have chosen to pursue a career in web development. I look forward to working on a team of developers.</li>

                <li>I am also a proud husband and father who dedicates most of my free time to my family.</li>

                <li>If we are not on family adventures, you will most likely find me on a skateboard or in my backyard tending to our garden.</li>
